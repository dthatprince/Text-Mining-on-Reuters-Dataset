The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial\\nservices firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.\\n    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at\\n72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.\\n    American Express would not comment on the rumors or its\\nstock activity.\\n    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts\\'\\nmeeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement\\nyesterday of management changes.\\n    At the meeting, company officials said American Express\\nstock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance\\nof Shearson, according to analysts.\\n    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief\\noperating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of\\npresident, which had been vacant. It also created four new\\npositions for chairmen of its operating divisions.\\n    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most\\nsense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total\\nspinoff.\\n    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of\\nShearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for\\nAmerican Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last\\nyear.\\n    \"I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is\\ngoing to sell shearson,\" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.\\nHe questioned what would be a better investment than \"a very\\nprofitable securities firm.\"\\n    Several analysts said American Express is not in need of\\ncash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong\\nasset.\\n    But others believe the company could very well of\\nconsidered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one\\nrumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.\\n    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he\\nbelieves American Express could have considered a partial\\nspinoff in the past.\\n    \"Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a\\nbig premium in the market place.

Analysts said the\\nspeculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of\\nthe profitable brokerage firm to the public.\\n    There was some speculation that American Express had also\\nconsidered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was\\nconsidered highly unlikely, analysts said.\\n     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it\\nwill not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman\\nwould not go beyond the statement. The company also remained\\nsilent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American\\nExpress stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it\\nto a Friday close at 74.\\n     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a\\nsimilar statement was being circulated to employees.\\n    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for\\nAmerican Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned\\nbrokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50\\npct in the last year.\\n    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning\\noff part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock\\nprice does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.\\n     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express\\'\\n1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.\\n    American Express\\' ambitious plans for international growth\\nmay be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part\\nof Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of\\nShearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.\\n    To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.\\n\"(American) Express is in a position where they can raise\\ncapital if they need to,\" said Larry Eckenfelder of\\nPrudential-Bache Securities.\\n    Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of\\nShearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey\\nLane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.\\n     The reorganization also created four new positions for\\nchairmen of Shearson\\'s operating divisions, a move analysts\\nspeculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.\\n     Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does\\nlittle to clarify last week\\'s market speculation. It does\\nconfirm, however, that the financial services firm, which\\nunsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major\\nacquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for\\ngrowth and positioning in the global market competition.\\n    Late last year, Shearson\\'s takeover offer to the E.F.\\nHutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said\\nthere had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when\\nit approached another major Wall Street brokerage.        \\n\\n',\n",

A source\\nclose to the management side insisted that timing was on his\\nside. He said if outside directors approve the management\\nproposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders\\nwith proxy material going out late this week. \"It would take 20\\ndays from the day we mail,\" said the source.\\n    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by\\ninvestor Sumner Redstone, would need \"half a year\" to complete\\na tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must\\naccompany any change in control of Viacom\\'s broadcast licenses\\nand cable television franchises.\\n    Redstone was not available for comment.\\n    Some of Wall Street\\'s arbitrage players said it was a rare\\nsituation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One\\nsaid Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and\\nif enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to\\nthe Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.\\n    The independent directors of Viacom were called into a\\nmeeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.\\n    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One\\nmajor Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. \"We think\\nwe\\'re at the end now, in terms of bidding,\" said the firm\\'s\\narbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.\\n    Both Redstone\\'s proposal and the management proposal would\\ncreate a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The\\nmanagement plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5\\nbillion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred\\nstock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.\\n    Redstone\\'s newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,\\na fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a\\nvalue of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock\\nstock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity\\ninterest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated\\nthe equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the\\ntotal package worth 52 dlrs per share.\\n    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable\\npreferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of\\nconvertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion\\nwas worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.\\n    Redstone\\'s newest plan raised the amount of interest he\\nwould pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond\\nApril 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The\\nplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct\\nduring May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered\\neight pct interest.\\n    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management\\ngroup, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,\\nwere offering high prices. \"Redstone really wants to own the\\ncompany,\" one said. Another said management seemed to have the\\nedge on the timing issue.\\n    Redstone\\'s company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom\\'s 35 mln shares.\\n    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what\\nthe equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He\\nnoted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp <FMC>, which\\nadopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally\\ntraded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now\\njust over 30 dlrs.\\n    Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two\\ntwo cts per share from 23 cts.

He said, however, there is\\nsupport for his offer.\\n    Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held\\ndiscussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc,\\nthe only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical\\nstock.\\n    Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, \\nsaid it held discussions with Pesch, American Medical\\nmanagement and other American Medical shareholders.\\n    Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission, said it believes a restructuring of American\\nMedical and its business would be \"highly desirable and\\nappropriate at this time.\"\\n    \"That\\'s the sort of position that I find a large segment of\\nshareholders of AMI really share,\" said Pesch.\\n    Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his\\ntakeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four\\ndlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each\\nAmerican Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in\\nan effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would not\\nrule out a future takeover try.\\n    Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal\\nwith the Bass family.\\n    Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch\\'s\\ntakeover effort and a further sign that there could be some\\nshareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical\\'s\\nprevious rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from\\nPesch.\\n    American Medical is expected to resist Pesch\\'s latest bid.\\nLarry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a\\nmanagement-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.\\n    An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment\\non the new Pesch offer by March 10.\\n    Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in\\nthe outcome of the bid for control of American Medical.\\n    The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American\\nMedical, and the company has previously said the investors\\nsupport management\\'s internal plan to improve the company\\'s\\nperformance. The Bass family would not comment on American\\nMedical or Pesch.\\n    Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp\\nlast year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall\\nStreet because of the long time it took to finish the Republic\\nacquisition.\\n    Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall\\nstreet questioning whether financing can be completed for the\\nmuch larger American Medical takeover proposal.\\n    Pesch\\'s first offer for American Medical was made without\\nan investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall\\nStreet. However, Pesch entered his second offer with\\nrepresentation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities\\nand Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.\\n    \"I don\\'t have any doubt that the current transaction can be\\nworked out and completed, provided we get to the point where\\nAmi management will sit down and talk in a friendly\\nenvironment,\" Pesch said.\\n    Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing\\narrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in\\nacquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American\\nMedical management in place.\\n    He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to\\nform an efficient network of hospitals.\\n    Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could\\nbe made for American Medical.\\n    Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second\\nfiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth\\nabout 20 dlrs per share.\\n    Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second\\nquarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct\\nloss last year.\\n    Nimocks said Pesch\\'s revised offer is not worth much more\\nthan the 20 dlrs cash offered previously.\\n    But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction\\ncould be completed because of the revised structure of the\\noffer. \"I think it\\'s much more doable,\" he said.\\n    Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround\\nby replacing some members of management and reducing costs.\\n\\n',\n",

The TWA offer was announced shortly\\nafter the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.\\n    TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It\\nalso said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and\\nthreatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer\\nfor 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.\\n    TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for\\nUSAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said\\nit alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the\\nairlines.\\n    Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman\\nCarl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into\\nthe takeover arena.\\n    \"We\\'re just wondering if he\\'s not just trying to get TWA\\ninto play. There\\'s speculation on the street he just wants to\\nmove onto somthing else,\" said one arbitrager. \"We think TWA\\nmight just be putting up a trial balloon.\"\\n    Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,\\nbut that the airline will probably reject it because the price\\nis relatively low compared to other airline deals.\\n    They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by\\nrevealing financing arrangements. \"They need to show their\\ncommitment and their ability to finance. I think it\\'s a\\ncredible offer,\" said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.\\n    \"I think it\\'s certainly on the low end of relative values\\nof airline deals,\" said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would\\nbe in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.\\n    USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A\\nspokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not\\nchanged its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of\\nthat airline\\'s stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance\\nfor 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.\\n    USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln\\nshares.\\n    Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also\\nremained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding\\n65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.\\n    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with\\nits offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont\\nand opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover\\nof Piedmont.\\n    Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to\\nmake his own airline a more attractive takeover target.\\n    \"Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there\\nwere no takers. I think the strategy might have called for\\nmaking his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish\\nthat specific objective is to go out and acquire other\\nairlines,\" said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.\\n    \"I don\\'t know whose going to buy them, but at least this\\nway it becomes a much more viable package,\" said Kim.\\n    But Icahn\\'s financing ability for such a transaction\\nremains in doubt, in part because of TWA\\'s heavy debt load.\\n    Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do\\nthe offer.\\n    The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial\\nadvisers and plans to make his own arrangements.\\n   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp <X>\\nand still retains 11 pct of that company\\'s stock.\\n    Some Wall street sources said the financier\\'s USX plan was\\nimpacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham\\nLambert Inc, because of Wall Street\\'s insider trading scandal.\\n    Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA\\noffer on price and financing concerns. \"It\\'s littered with\\ncontingencies and it doesn\\'t even have a financing\\narrangement,\" said one executive at another major airline.\\n    But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a\\nstrong contender with USAir\\'s east coast route system and\\nplanned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the\\nintenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in\\nits St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,\\nto the mix would develop an even stronger force.\\n    The combined entity would also have TWA\\'s pars reservation\\nsystem.\\n    Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would\\nresult in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.\\n   \\n\\n',\n",

The move complicated a USAir\\ntakeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to\\naccepting the bid.\\n    Today, USAir rejected Icahn\\'s 52 dlr per share offer and\\nsaid the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its\\ntakeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.\\n    Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was\\noff 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread\\nit would be taken over.\\n    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt\\nto either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a\\nsuitor who might want both airlines once they merged.\\n   \"The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or\\nPiedmont and USAir announce a deal,\" speculated one arbitrager.\\n    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current\\nprice of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir\\'s bid will\\nsucceed.\\n    Piedmont\\'s largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk\\nSouthern Corp <NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the\\ncompany. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of\\nPiedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.\\n    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of\\nPiedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is\\ndestined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the\\nleast likely to be bought.\\n    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in\\nthe airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a\\nthree-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.\\n    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn\\'s\\noffer, which lacked financing and was riddled with\\ncontingencies.\\n    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two\\nairlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.\\n    \"You can\\'t discount him,\" said one arbitrager.\\n    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is\\nserious by following through with his threats or making a new\\noffer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go\\ndirectly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower\\nprice if USAir rejected his offer.\\n    \"It\\'s clear Icahn wants to sell and he\\'s bluffing,\" said\\none arbitrager.\\n    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by\\nabout six dlrs per share.\\n    Some analysts believe Icahn\\'s proposed three-way airline\\ncombination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but\\nothers believe it could be cleared if the companies are\\nacquired separately.\\n    \"TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to\\nwork,\" said one analyst.\\n    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and\\ncomplicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn\\nsucceeded in winning concessions from its unions.\\n    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA\\'s wage\\nscale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,\\nanalysts said.\\n    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they\\nsaid. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines\\'\\ncosts when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a\\nnecessary ingredient for a merger to work.\\n    However, other analysts speculated the managements of\\nPiedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new\\ncompany. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way\\nfor him to exit the company if USAir\\'s airline is then merged\\ninto TWA.\\n\\n',\n",

Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from\\nHughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said\\nit was still interested in the merger.\\n    The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its\\ntroubles could make it a takeover candidate.\\n    There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas\\ninvestor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters\\nhe is not interested.\\n    Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities\\nand Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in\\nsome publicly traded company. He declined to identify the\\ntarget other than to rule out Hughes.\\n    One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes\\nturnabout was Borg-Warner Corp <BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of\\nHughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on the\\nHughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker.\\n    Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a\\nmerger, and Baker\\'s response that a merger is still possibile,\\nanalysts said no one could be certain where the situation was\\ngoing.\\n    \"I think the merger is not going through,\" said Phil Pace,\\nanalyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger \"lost a\\nlot of its appeal\" when the U.S. Department of Justice required\\nthat Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation.\\n    Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of\\nthe total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said \"30 to 40\\npct of the cost savings are tied up in that.\"\\n    \"They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,\"\\nsaid James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.\\n\"Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but\\nwhether they will alter their position, I don\\'t know.\\n    \"It\\'s getting a little confusing,\" said James Carroll,\\nanalyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited\\nby Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger \"tend to be weak.\"\\nHughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it\\nwanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,\\nthe projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer\\nperiod of time.\\n    Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the\\ncompanies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker\\napparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.\\n    Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln\\ndlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling\\nReed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be\\nsaved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.\\n    Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first\\nsigned \"the outlook for the industry has improved materially.\"\\nHughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry\\nis lifting.\\n\\n',\n",

So\\n(the sale) does make a lot of sense,\" Mote said.\\n    However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest\\nEncor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale\\nproceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome\\'s debt to\\nCommerce Bank.\\n    \"I think they\\'ll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as\\nthey can,\" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.\\n    Some of Dome\\'s group of 56 major creditors might move to\\nblock such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.\\n    \"Other creditors generally all want to make sure that\\nsomething they might be able to get a piece of is not being\\nsold out from under them,\" said analyst Gobert.\\n    Another stumbling block would be Encor\\'s 225 mln dlr joint\\nliability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic\\nPetroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.\\n    Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the\\npossible sale of Dome Petroleum\\'s interest in Dome Mines.\\n    Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum\\'s\\ndebt and has a \"right of consent\" to the sale of Dome Petroleum\\'s\\nholding.\\n    Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares\\nwould seek some type of relief on the company\\'s debt\\nobligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.\\n    Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what\\nprice the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,\\nbut said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share \"are very\\nattractive.\"\\n\\n',\n",

And payment of greenmail, or a preferential\\nprice by a target company to buy back a raider\\'s stake, should\\nbe prohibited under the revised laws.\\n    Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but\\nthat he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets\\nor discourage \"fair price to all\" takeovers.\\n\\n',\n",

Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of\\nits Purolator courier division\\'s management.\\n    The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one.\\n    Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities\\nand Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned\\nfrom its board of directors in a letter dated March 10.\\n    The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because\\nthe merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from\\nsoliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a\\nbetter deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might be\\nfound if the company would agree to be sold to some other\\nentity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier\\ndivision.\\n    \"Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has\\n450 mln dlrs in revenues. It\\'s a very large company and it\\'s\\nbeing sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs,\" said Gardner in a telephone\\ninterview with Reuters.\\n    Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm\\nassociated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity\\ncompanies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he\\npersonally owns 20,000 shares.\\n    A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the\\nletter from Gardner.\\n    Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service\\nmay emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the\\ntransaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also\\nspeculated another courier company would be the most likely\\nsuitor.\\n    While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no\\nnew bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed\\nthe stock into play again.\\n    \"There\\'s no shortage of possibilities. It\\'s just a question\\nof management\\'s willingness to let the process continue,\" said\\none arbitrager.\\n    Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they\\nbelieve Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.\\nHutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs\\ncash per share. The balance of Purolator\\'s stock will be bought\\nfor securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.\\ncourier operations.\\n    The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that\\nHutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and\\nwill emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in\\nPurolator.\\n    \"As far as I can tell from the public documents from the\\ndeal that\\'s on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.\\nOne always likes a situation like that. You always like to\\nthink if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be\\nsomeone else in the world that could do it higher,\" said one\\narbitrager.\\n    The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and\\nsources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the\\nfirm will not end up paying for its equity position.\\n    While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document\\ndid note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to\\nkeep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some\\nrisk to the firm.\\n    \"There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,\\nand all sorts of things that make it very speculative,\" said\\none of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to\\nemployees.\\n    The E.F.

The bridge\\nfinancing is a temporary loan from Hutton.\\n    The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing,\\nexpected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to\\nreplace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could\\nbe a substantial expense to the firm.\\n    Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln\\ndlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction\\nsaid fees are at the low end of the scale.\\n    \"It\\'s a very complex transaction, but basically what\\nhappens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture\\nany investment they might have once the merger takes place,\"\\nGardner said.\\n\\n',\n",

The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature.\\n    The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that\\nsaid the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be\\nconsummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate\\nbanking outside of New England come down. \"If we can consummate\\nthe deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,\"\\nLougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in\\nthe Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other\\nbanking institution in the state.\\n    He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which only\\npermits interstate banking mergers within New England, can be\\namended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp.\\n    If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said,\\nan option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase\\nprovisions.\\n    The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New\\nYork as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled\\nup by the money center giants.\\n    Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet\\nand Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of\\ninterstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain\\npermitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S.\\nSupreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers.\\n    Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed\\nmerger as \"a partnership of two companies.\" Both will continue\\nto operate existing headquarters after the merger.\\n    Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one\\nof theirs following Fleet\\'s previously announced two-for-one\\nsplit. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving the\\ndeal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs.\\n    That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based\\nSecurity Pacific Corp <SPC> and Seattle\\'s Rainier Bancorpartion\\n<RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, is\\nworth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs.\\n    Chemical New York Corp\\'s <CHL> acquisition of Texas\\nCommerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion\\ndlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer\\ndeal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co <WFC>\\nand Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs\\nand there have been several bank mergers in the southeast\\nvalued in the 700-800 mln dlr range.\\n    \"It\\'s a merger of equals,\" said analyst John Rooney of\\nMoseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at\\nthe end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet\\'s book\\nvalue was 28.02 dlrs.\\n    Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his\\n60\\'s while Fleet\\'s Terrence Murray is in his late 40\\'s. He said\\nKiernan would probably head the combined company until his\\nretirement then Murray could assume the top post.\\n    Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said\\nFleet\\'s earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986\\non the basis of the merger terms announced today.\\n    He noted that Fleet has a \"teriffic reputation\" after\\nhaving diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has\\nestablished consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an\\ninnovator in securitization of mortgages.\\n    The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion\\ndlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstar\\noperates in most of New York state but not in New York City.\\n    Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations\\nthat both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would\\nbe combined.\\n    The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a\\n\"lock-up\" option designed to deter other acquirers. Each\\ngranted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued\\nshares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares\\noutstanding.\\n\\n',\n",
